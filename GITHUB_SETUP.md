# GitHub Setup Guide for SocialScaleBooster

## ðŸ”§ Git Commands to Push Your Code

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/runner/workspace

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: SocialScaleBooster v1.0 with core features"
```

### Step 2: Connect to GitHub Repository

**Current Situation: Remote has existing files**
Since your remote repository already has some files, you need to merge them first:

```bash
# Pull and merge remote changes (this handles conflicts automatically)
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them manually, then:
# git add .
# git commit -m "Merge remote changes"

# Push your complete codebase
git push origin main
```

**Alternative: Force push (only if you want to replace everything on GitHub)**
```bash
# WARNING: This will replace ALL content on GitHub with your local files
git push origin main --force
```

**If repo was empty initially (backup option)**
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/boweazy/SocialScaleBooster.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Future Updates
```bash
# After making changes to your code:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Push Checklist

- [ ] All files created (main.py, README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore)
- [ ] Code tested and working
- [ ] README.md is complete and informative
- [ ] License added (MIT License)
- [ ] .gitignore properly excludes unnecessary files

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Push

1. **Create a GitHub Release**: Tag v1.0.0 with release notes
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: For a project website (optional)
3. **Add Collaborators**: If working with a team
4. **Set up GitHub Actions**: For automated testing (future enhancement)
5. **Create Issues**: For feature requests and bug tracking
